# Stage 1: Build stage
# ----------------------
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk AS build     # 👉 Use JDK 21 (full JDK, includes compiler & tools)
WORKDIR /app                             # 👉 Set working directory inside the container
COPY . .                                 # 👉 Copy all project files into /app
RUN ./mvnw -B clean package -DskipTests  # 👉 Run Maven Wrapper (mvnw) to build JAR (skip tests for speed)

# ----------------------
# Stage 2: Runtime stage
# ----------------------
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre              # 👉 Use a smaller JRE-only base image (lighter than JDK)
WORKDIR /app                             # 👉 Working directory for runtime container
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar  # 👉 Copy the built JAR from "build" stage into runtime stage
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"]    # 👉 Run Spring Boot app when container starts
