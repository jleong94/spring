/**
 * Custom HTTP servlet request wrapper that caches the request body for multiple reads.
 * 
 * <p><b>Problem it solves:</b></p>
 * In a standard HTTP request, the input stream can only be read once. This becomes problematic
 * when multiple components (filters, interceptors, controllers) need to access the request body.
 * For example, when validating a signature in a filter and then deserializing the same body
 * in a controller with {@code @RequestBody}, the second read would fail with "Required request body is missing".
 * 
 * <p><b>How it works:</b></p>
 * This wrapper reads and caches the entire request body into a byte array when the wrapper is created.
 * Subsequent calls to {@code getInputStream()} or {@code getReader()} return new instances that read
 * from the cached byte array, allowing the body to be read multiple times throughout the request lifecycle.
 * 
 * <p><b>Use cases:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Request signature validation in filters (e.g., HMAC, RSA signature verification)</li>
 *   <li>Request body logging for audit trails</li>
 *   <li>Custom request validation before reaching the controller</li>
 *   <li>Rate limiting based on request body content</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // In a servlet filter
 * CachedBodyHttpServletRequest cachedRequest = new CachedBodyHttpServletRequest(request);
 * 
 * // Read body for signature validation
 * String body = cachedRequest.getBody();
 * boolean isValid = validateSignature(body, request.getHeader("SIGNATURE"));
 * 
 * // Pass wrapped request down the chain - controller can still read the body
 * chain.doFilter(cachedRequest, response);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p><b>Memory consideration:</b></p>
 * The entire request body is loaded into memory. For very large payloads (e.g., file uploads),
 * consider implementing a size limit or using streaming approaches instead.
